This folder contains miscellaneous code that was used to generate various figures in the paper.

`analytic_sphere.py`

Used to compute the analytic scattering of a plane wave off a rigid sphere, and also compare the values to the BEM simulation.

`plot_coeffs.py`

Used to plot the diffusion coefficients for initial visualization

`pressure_calcs.py`

Used to compute the actual pressure values for various meshes acting as diffusers.

`tracker_opt.py`

Used to explore and visualize the intermediate meshes generated during optimization.
